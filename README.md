# RCM Exam Wizard

See it live: [RCM Exam Wizard](https://wondrous-kheer-3bef24.netlify.app/)

## Description
A simple web app (desktop and mobile-friendly) that lets users select a specific examination level from a drop-down menu and see a neat summary of everything they need to learn for that particular exam.

## Background & Motivation
This was a passion project for me. Music, and piano specifically, is a big hobby of mine and RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music) is a popular authority here in Canada when it comes to music exams. I myself have gone through almost all of their piano exams and wanted to make it easy for aspiring examinees to see exactly what they need to learn for each level of the RCM piano exams. It can also help piano teachers know exactly what they need to teach their students for each exam level.

## Technologies
The current version of this project was done with:
* HTML 
* Bootstrap CSS
* JavaScript

## State of Completion
Completed. If I decide to make this app available to the larger public and it receives wider use, I will consider adding more features in the future, such as exam information for other instruments in addition to piano, such as violin, cello, guitar, etc. But for now, I decided to stick with just piano as it is the most popular instrument for RCM exams.

## Learning Lessons & Challenges
### Switch Statement
This gave me a great opportunity to practice using the "switch statement" in js, so that a particular exam information is displayed depending on the select option the user chooses.

### Bootstrap
I decided to use bootstrap to quickly style this project and make it responsive. It was fun to remember bootstrap class names.

### Modules
I put the code for all the exam levels in a separate module which was then impmorted to the main "script.js" file. This helped keep the code clean and well-organized.


## Summary
As mentioned, this was a great little passion project that I really enjoyed making. It solves a real-world problem for music students/teachers in providing all exam information at one glance, neatly organized in a table. This is something I wish I had when I was preparing for my piano exams!
